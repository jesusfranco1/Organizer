# Organizer
This web application is intended to give you the optimal locations to study based on places you frequent. Places have to be 
entered manualy for now until I find a way to track locations from ones cellular device or fitbit.

Make sure Flask is installed. You also need geocoder which I included the command for its instalation bellow.

To run this application:
 
$ pip install geocoder

$ export FLASK_APP=app.py

$ flask run
